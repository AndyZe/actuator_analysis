### What is the "latency of best fit" for each actuator across the entire dataset?

For this calculation I used numpy.correlate. It looks at the entire dataset minus a small window around firing (excluded because firing is not normal motion.)

For pitch, the "latency of best fit" was **X seconds**. For yaw, the "latency of best fit" was **X seconds**. Very similar.

The script used in this calculation was scripts/bulk_latency_calculation.py.

As a sanity check, here are graphs comparing the two signals for the first 100s.

![Pitch current and target except firing (first 100 s)](./graphics/pitch_current_and_target_except_firing_first_100s.png)

![Yaw current and target except firing (first 100 s)](./graphics/yaw_current_and_target_except_firing_first_100s.png)


I can tell from the pitch graph already that **pitch does not track slow position changes well**.
